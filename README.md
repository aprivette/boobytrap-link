# Boobytrap Link

A small script to track thieves by logging their IP addresses and computer specs.  Personally, I host mine on a subdomain of my site.  Then, I created a bookmark, placed it on a USB, and locked it up alongside my valuables in a portable safe.  Uses a query variable to block stray users.
